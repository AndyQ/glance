# My Document

## R Markdown

```{r include = FALSE}
print("Hello world from R")
```

## Emphasis

This is a Markdown document. It may contain **bold** or _italic_ text. Text can also be **_both bold and italic_**.

## Lists

Markdown supports ordered and unordered lists, which may be nested:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
   - Item 2a
   - Item 2b

## Code

This `code` is inline. The following is a code block with syntax highlighting:

```{python}
print("Hello world from Python")
```

## Links

Links can be created explicitly ([example](https://example.com)) or detected automatically (https://example.com).

## Blockquotes

You can easily create quotes:

> This is the quote's first line.
>
> This is the second one.
